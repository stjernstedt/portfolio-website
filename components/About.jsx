					<div className='lg:text-xl'>
						I am a beginner full stack developer and my strong points at the moment are JavaScript, React, and CSS but also have experience in Java and C# as
						well as the Unity game engine. I graduated from the university of GÃ¤vle(my home town) with a degree in computer science, and more specifically
						system development, where I learned among other things Java, HTML, CSS and how to structure a system from the ground up. Always being interested in
						learning new things and finding programming highly enjoyable I have since graduating kept on learning new languages and frameworks, with the most
						recent being React. I my spare time, aside from working on personal projects, I enjoy playing games and during winter I try to go snowboarding as
						much as I can.
